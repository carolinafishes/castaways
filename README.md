# castaways
Included in this repository are scripts by Thomas Howard for the manipulation of the data acquired from the citizen science project [Castaway.](https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/zhcreech/castaway)

Scripts are annotated and any questions should be directed to Thomas Howard [jthowar3@ncsu.edu](jthowar3@ncsu.edu).

Both the Castaway project and the creation of these scripts was made possible in part by the Institute of Museum and Library Services [MA-30-18-0275-18].
